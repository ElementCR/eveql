Hello! 

Welcome to the eveql project! If you are an eve online player or an enthusiast for working with economic data, then this project should interest you.

This project was created in attempts to gain more solid understanding with Node.JS, MySQL, and Angular2.js

3/22/2017 - 
As of this point I have been focused on node.js and creating applications that can retrieve item name input and return all of the required materials to create objects that can be manufactured in the game. (materialFinder.js)

There is also a very small and raw perspective on the economic data that will be needed to help fine tune the whole application for my manufacturing analysis tool. This application will, in the future, be used to perform an entire scan and market analysis in order to find the best items to invest and trade for the day related to volume and price. (ecSpreadFinder.js)

The economic data will be retrieved from eve-central.com.

I am using MySQL to organize item and economic data, it should be found within the repo for you to mimic the table structures if need be.

If you are interested in pursuing one of the backend projects or features feel free to contact me about it. Also, if you are more interested in frontend, there will be a section of folders attributed to the Angular 2.4 framework to display all of our wonderful data that we have accumulated.

Thank you very much, and enjoy.
